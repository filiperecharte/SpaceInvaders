## The Game
In this project we built the Space Invaders that is a fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at the enemies. The aim is to defeat some rows of moving enemies, horizontally accross the screen.</br>
The ship has some walls protecting it from the enemies and has a limited number of lifes.</br>
The enemies can also fire at the ship and have different strengths.
